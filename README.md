Base game GameMaker version: `IDE v2024.6.2.162 Runtime v2024.6.1.208`


You can download the playable game from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/dlbrown1223/microgames/releases).



### Setup for making a GameMaker microgame

- Create a project
- Goto `tools > import local package` and import all files from the microgame_system.yymps
- In the "Microgame" folder, take a look at `scr_microgame_config` and `scr_microgame_functions`. 
- Be sure to edit your game's metadata.json in the included files. This tells the base game what prompt to show, who made the game, and what control scheme it has. 


### Testing your microgame

- Download the base game.
- Put your compiled project (.zip or folder) into the base game's "games" folder with the other games.
- Your game folder or .zip should contain at least: a game executable and a metadata.json.
- Open the base game and you should see your game listed in the gallery!
